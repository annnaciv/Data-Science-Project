    "1. Understand the Dataset\n",
    "Explore the data:\n",
    "- Review column types,\n",
    "- understand the range of values, and identify what each feature represents (categorical, numerical, or ordinal).\n",
    "- Define your target variable: Decide which column(s) will be the dependent variable (e.g., PSS_score).\n",
    "- Check for missing data: Identify missing or null values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clean the Dataset\n",
    "- Handle missing data\n",
    "- Drop rows or columns if the proportion of missing data is significant and imputation isn’t suitable.\n",
    "- Identify outliers or values outside expected ranges and address them (e.g., sleep_duration values < 0 adjusted with +24).\n",
    "- Clip or transform data to appropriate ranges (e.g., ensure sleep_time values are in a 24-hour format).\n",
    "- Ensure consistent formats\n",
    "- Verify Data Quality: (e.g., wake_time + sleep_duration = sleep_time).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "- Derive meaningful new features from existing ones (e.g., calculate total sleep time from wake_time and sleep_duration).\n",
    "- Drop columns that don’t contribute to the prediction task (e.g., unique IDs like participant_id).\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Normalize or standardize numerical data: Apply scaling (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standard Scaling) to ensure numerical data has comparable ranges.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Verify Data Quality\n",
    "- Remove duplicate rows that may bias the model.\n",
    "- Verify that derived features (e.g., sleep_time) match expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Split the Dataset\n",
    "Separate features and target:\n",
    "Divide the data into X (features) and y (target variable).\n",
    "Train-test split:\n",
    "Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 70%-30% or 80%-20%).\n",
    "Optional validation split:\n",
    "Further split the training data into training and validation subsets to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "7. Address Data Imbalance\n",
    "Analyze target distribution:\n",
    "If the target variable is imbalanced (e.g., binary classification with uneven classes), consider resampling techniques.\n",
    "Use SMOTE, oversampling, or undersampling to address class imbalance.\n",
    "8. Save the Processed Dataset\n",
    "Save the cleaned and processed data to a file (e.g., CSV, Parquet) for easy reuse.\n",
    "9. Document and Visualize\n",
    "Document all steps for reproducibility.\n",
    "Use visualizations to explore relationships between features and the target variable (e.g., correlation heatmaps, scatterplots)."
